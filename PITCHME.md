---
### @color[#DC143C](Django)
  Django is a free and open source web application framework written in Python. A framework is nothing more than a collection of modules that make development easier.

---

### @color[#DC143C](Installation of Django)
     					pip install django

---
### @color[#DC143C](Create Django Project)
- startproject |
	  django-admin startproject mysite

Note:
- This will create a mysite directory in your current directory, and the structure would like this.

---
### @color[#DC143C](Create post application)
- startapp |
	   django-admin startapp post
- Application Structure |

### @color[#DC143C](default View)
- Run Server |
	  python manage.py runserver
- You can access your application using the following URL. |
	  http://127.0.0.1:8000

Note:
- This is the default view of the django application.
- Now we will learn CRUD operation using CRUDLFAP.

---
### @css[crudlfa-headline](Integration of CRUDLFA+)

- You can install CRUDLFA+ by the following ways. |
	- Installing from pip |
		  pip install crudlfap
	- If you are not in a virtualenv, the above will fail if not executed as root, in this case use |
		  pip install --user crudlfap

-  Register custom application with Django |
	   INSTALLED_APPS = [

- makemigrations for post model
	   python manage.py makemigrations

Note:
